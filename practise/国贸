Definition of marketing channel:
    It refers to the middle man or the intermediarists who buy and sell or involved in the process
    of moving products to the customers.

Main types of marketing channels:
    merchants and agents

    They have to buy the products first and then resell them. They have the title/ownership of the products.
    Wholesaler, retailer, distributor, etc.

Agents:
    They do not have to buy the products first and then resell. They just find the customers and then 
    negotiate with them on behalf of manufactures. They do not have the title/owenership of the products.
    They make profits from the commission.

The whole channels:
    Exporter, distributor, wholesaler, retailer, customers.

Different products have different channels:
    Consuming products (for consumption) have longer channels
    Industrial products (for reproduction) have shorter channels.

The advantages of distributing from the channels:
    1. Saving money and time for the exporter. It will effectively reduce the contacters between the 
        exporters and customers.
    2. Increasing the exporters' sales. 
        Distributors are professional for selling, and more familiar with the importing country's market
        condition.
    3. Transferring more attention to the exporters' main business: production/manufacturing
    4. Improving the services for customes, including the pre-sell service and the post-sell service.

Special channels involved in the international trade
    1. Distributor. They buy the products from the exporter and then resell them. Some of them have the 
        exclusive right. It means that if other sellers want to sell the products, they have to buy the 
        goods from the exclusive distributor. 
    2. Consignment distributor. They do not have to pay for the goods immediately until they sold part or all
        of the goods successfully. The risks for manufactures will be increased, so more paper work will be
        required. And the price of the products will increase a little. 
    3. import house. They buy the products first and then resell them. They establish the short term
        business relations with the exporter. They do not have the regular customer.
    4. Government department. They can buy amount of goods, but they cannot be given the exclusive rights. 
    5. State-buying organizations. They are the state owned importing and exporting companies. They have
        special licenses. 
    6. Wholesalers. They buy the goods from the distributor and then resell the goods to the retailer.
        If there is no distributor, they can buy the goods directly from the exporter.
    7. Retailers. They buy the goods from the wholesalers, and resell them to the individual customers.

Some consideration for agent selection
    1. Making sure the potential agent is a respectable businessman or a reliable company. They should have
        a good commercial reputation.
    2. Making sure the potential agent has some facilities to achieve the exporters' selling goals such as 
        offices, transportation vehicles, computers, photocopyers etc. 
    3. Making sure the potential agent has his own resources to access customers or even the government.
    4. Making sure the potential agent has the long term interests in handling the exporters' products. 

Main income for agents
    The commission is the main income for agents, normally percentage of value of goods given by the 
    exporter (1% ~ 10%)

Special Agent -- "Del-credere agent" 
    They have to be responsible for the payment for the exporter. If the customers failed to pay the
    exporter, they are responsible for it. They take more risks, so that higher commission is requried.
