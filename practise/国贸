        goods from the exclusive distributor. 
    2. Consignment distributor. They do not have to pay for the goods immediately until they sold part or all
        of the goods successfully. The risks for manufactures will be increased, so more paper work will be

        business relations with the exporter. They do not have the regular customer.

        special licenses. 
    6. Wholesalers. They buy the goods from the distributor and then resell the goods to the retailer.
        If there is no distributor, they can buy the goods directly from the exporter.
    7. Retailers. They buy the goods from the wholesalers, and resell them to the individual customers.

Some consideration for agent selection
    1. Making sure the potential agent is a respectable businessman or a reliable company. They should have
        a good commercial reputation.
    2. Making sure the potential agent has some facilities to achieve the exporters' selling goals such as 
        offices, transportation vehicles, computers, photocopyers etc. 
    3. Making sure the potential agent has his own resources to access customers or even the government.
    4. Making sure the potential agent has the long term interests in handling the exporters' products. 

Main income for agents

    exporter (1% ~ 10%)
